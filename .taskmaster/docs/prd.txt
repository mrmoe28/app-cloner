# Overview  
App Cloner is a comprehensive web application that allows users to analyze, clone, and recreate existing applications. The platform provides AI-powered analysis of application screenshots, generates detailed technical specifications, and offers tools for recreating applications with modern web technologies. This tool serves developers, designers, and product managers who want to understand existing applications or create similar ones efficiently.

# Core Features  
## Application Analysis

- Automatic detection of UI components, layouts, and design patterns
- Generation of detailed technical specifications
- Component hierarchy and structure analysis

## Code Generation
- Automated code generation based on analysis results
- Support for Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Integration with modern UI libraries (Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui)
- Responsive design implementation

## Project Management
- User authentication and project organization
- Dashboard for managing multiple analysis projects
- Export capabilities for generated specifications
- Collaboration features for team workflows

## UI Agent System
- Automated application testing and analysis
- Accessibility auditing and recommendations
- Visual regression testing
- Performance analysis and optimization suggestions

# User Experience  
## Primary User Personas
- **Developers**: Need to understand existing applications and generate code quickly
- **Designers**: Want to analyze UI patterns and recreate designs
- **Product Managers**: Need to document and analyze competitor applications

## Key User Flows
1. **Upload & Analyze**: User uploads application screenshots → AI analyzes components → Generates detailed report
2. **Generate Code**: User reviews analysis → Selects components → Generates Next.js/React code
3. **Project Management**: User creates project → Manages multiple analyses → Exports results

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, modern interface with intuitive navigation
- Real-time analysis feedback and progress indicators
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile usage
